Shanti Mathias is a journalist, zine-maker and cyclist currently based between Ōtautahi and Tāmaki Makaurau. I've worked for The Spinoff for the last three years
where I've covered two elections and been to the Chatham Islands once. Before that I was a news and features writer at the very cool student magazine Salient. 
I have Indian and Pākeha heritage, and was lucky enough to grow up between both India and Aotearoa. My parents work has really inspired me, and I'm lucky to
have been exposed to lots of different circumstances, from small Himalayan villages to Delhi slums to the wilds of Mount Roskill to a very privileged boarding 
school. 

I have a degree in anthropology and English literature which captures lots of the work I do now: reading things, writing things, being very curious and paying 
attention to people. I still love reading and have definitely regained my love for novels after having to read many of them for my degree. These are areas of study 
I would definitely like to return to in the future!  

I have what many have described as "too many hobbies". Or does that mean "too much free time? I read lots of books, run relatively slowly around the neighbourhood and up
whichever hills I can find, have been slowly getting into movies (as a concept!) over the last few years. I really like having non-screen based creative outputs, like 
knitting and have been learning how to sew, mostly clothes, which has been a recent joy. I've been slowly learning how to spin wool on a drop spindle and a wheel, and will 
happily talk about these things if you ask! There's something very appealing about having hobbies that don't require looking at a screen and I also love having skills that 
can solve problems in my own life and the community around me. 

I think lots about economic justice and liberations, the role of joy as an organising and motivating force for activism, climate action and policy solutions where a small, 
cheap change can make a big difference. At the moment I mostly tackle this through my professional work, and have lots to learn about these ideas. I also really care about
community building and repairing and maintaining good things that are already going on as a way to feel tangibly connected to the world. 

This website is a place to document some of the work I've done and the stuff I care about. Some of the ideas that I'm currently thinking through, books that have made a big
difference in my life, writing I'm particularly proud of, both journalistic and otherwise. I'm not currently seeking work outside of my role at The Spinoff but will update
this if that changes. If you want to contact me, get in touch!
