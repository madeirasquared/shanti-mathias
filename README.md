# shanti mathias
<b> shanti </b> is making her own website and putting it here

shanti is a journalist who has too many hobbies

she is currently very into samantha shannon books 

she often forgets about the bread she is making 

she is not fast at running 

she likes lush flower trees and little puzzles and eating kale from the garden 

she is currently twenty five and doesn't really know much about the world.
