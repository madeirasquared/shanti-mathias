**writing for the spinoff**

I have written so many pieces for The Spinoff but these are some of my favourites and/or crowd favourites. I might add some of my favourite pieces from beloved student magazine Salient one day too. 

_longreads_

[Connecting the Chathams](https://thespinoff.co.nz/internet/10-06-2022/connecting-the-chathams) How do you get internet to somewhere hundreds of kilometres away from the nearest land? Not included in the story: a plot to grow weed around a server farm, the offer of an arranged marriage, breaking one law, holding a baby petrel. 

[International education changed India. It's changing New Zealand, too](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/08-01-2024/international-education-changed-india-its-changing-new-zealand-too-2) Everyone involved in the international education industry knows what they're trading. This is a story about the many faces of wealth. 

[Summer is for swimming. But what's in the water?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/15-12-2023/summer-is-for-swimming-but-whats-in-the-water) The idea is that you can tell how much I love swimming in rivers in this story. A joy to report! 

[Can Sandringham's South Asian flavour survive gentrification?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/08-07-2024/can-sandringhams-south-asian-flavour-survive-gentrification) Lotta knocking on doors was required for this one

[Staring down the silent epidemic of myopia in children](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/15-04-2024/staring-down-the-silent-epidemic-of-childrens-myopia) Winner of the inaugural Science Media Centre Journalism award in 2024 in the junior category <3 I loved working on this one - it's an example of an issue that is important where known interventions could make a huge difference.

_below: any day I get to wear hi-vis is a good day. This was for the 'summer is for swimming'story vising a Central Interceptor site in Auckland_

_fun stories_

[Rainbow warmth and garish colours: what happened to stripey polypro?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/08-07-2024/rainbow-warmth-and-garish-colours-when-did-stripy-polyprop-disappear) Featuring a small Shanti decked out like a synthetic zebra. 

[How far can you go without leaving your street?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/07-01-2024/how-far-can-you-go-without-leaving-your-street-2) In which Shanti spends seven days on the same road. One of those stories you really regret pitching.... 

[What's behind the explosion of apple varieties at the supermarket?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/28-03-2024/whats-behind-the-explosion-of-apple-varieties-at-the-supermarket) and [When it comes to mangoes, New Zealanders aren't getting the good stuff](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/14-06-2023/when-it-comes-to-mangoes-new-zealanders-arent-getting-the-good-stuff) Two delicious fruity stories! 

[Inside an exclusive, chaotic, painful NFT party](https://thespinoff.co.nz/summer-2022/31-12-2022/inside-an-exclusive-chaotic-painful-nft-party) Would NOT recommend attending an NFT party! 

_stories I really love and think are important_
[The 'third world' isn't the bogeyman New Zealand media and politicians make it out to be](https://thespinoff.co.nz/media/26-05-2023/the-third-world-isnt-the-bogeyman-new-zealand-seems-to-think-it-is) Using 'third world' in a derogatory way goes to show how ignorant it is to assume that places where brown people live are bad. See also [Dileepa Foneska's examination](https://businessdesk.co.nz/article/economy/nz-and-third-world-lessons-for-politicians-and-businesspeople) of what Aotearoa can learn from the 'third world' for BusinessDesk. Mostly I wrote this because hearing 'third world' on the radio every second morning makes me feel like I'm losing my mind. 

[If there was a disaster next week, where would you go for food?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/20-03-2024/if-there-was-a-disaster-next-week-where-would-you-go-for-food) Loved doing lots of reporting for this, talking to food rescue organisations and academics and having to think about climate disaster in practical terms. 

[New Zealand isn't doing enough to fund climate action. This is how we know](https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/13-09-2024/new-zealand-isnt-doing-enough-to-fund-climate-action-this-is-how-we-know) The journalist's curse is that you read some bland report about cliamte funding and then discover that it is interesting and important and the details seriously matter

[From fish to flour to feta, snow feeds us all](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/10-07-2024/from-fish-to-flour-to-feta-snow-feeds-us-all) Figuring out how to conect these ideas about snowmelt and crops was quite difficult but I'm glad that I managed to pull it together.

[Sinking lids and rising profits: the problem with pokies](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/25-06-2024/sinking-lids-and-rising-profits-the-problem-with-pokies) Tfw you think 'hey did that new policy a council put in place a few years ago actually work?' 

[Supermarkets know everything about you, from your gender to your license plate number. Do you care?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/25-03-2024/supermarkets-know-everything-from-your-gender-to-licence-plate-number-do-you-care) Surveillance is so normal and yet we must question it, must try to keep noticing it.

[Why so many nurses move to New Zealand and don't plan to stick around](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/12-07-2024/why-so-many-nurses-move-to-new-zealand-but-dont-plan-to-stick-around) Some of the same ground as my Indian international students story: people act within immigration settings in particular ways, and yet the consequences are so unpredictable.

**creative writing**

_essays_

[I grew up riding trains across India](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/19-02-2023/the-sunday-essay-i-grew-up-riding-trains-across-india)


[What I learned - and didn't learn - from four years of homeschooling](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/10-10-2024/what-i-learned-and-didnt-learn-from-four-years-of-home-education) Aka what was Shanti's childhood like? Kinda unusual but also great! 

[Knots](https://www.starlingmag.com/issue-9/shanti-mathias), published in Starling Magazine. 

_short stories_

My short story '[getting closer](https://turbinekapohau.org.nz/2024-contents-fiction-shanti-mathias/)' appears in the 2024 edition of IIML literary journal Turbine | Kapohau. You should read it, it involves anxious 19 year olds, a random austrian man and the jungle.

If you somehow come across a copy of [Sick Leave Journal's](https://www.instagram.com/sickleave__/?hl=en) 'fiction' issue from 2021, there is a story I wrote in there! I think it's pretty good. If you are unlikely to run across copies of small Australian literary journals, email me and I can send you a pdf of the story probably. It involves cousins, pyramid schemes and anxious 19 year olds. 

_newsletters_
[The American-ness of Christian memes](https://www.modernrelics.email/the-american-ness-of-christian-memes/) Rohan Salmond of the WONDERFUL newsletter Modern Relics let me write a post! 

[The next big target for disinformation? Climate change.](https://spinofffutureproof.substack.com/p/the-next-big-target-for-disinformation) I subbed in for [Ellen Rykers](https://www.ellenrykers.com/) and wrote an edition of Future Proof, her Spinoff newsletter focused on climate change.

I also wrote The Spinoff's The Weekend newsletter for two years. 

_poetry_
I write one good poem every two years! My dear friend Naomii has pointed out that the hit rate would be higher if I wrote more. Maybe one day some of these poems will come to live on this website, who knows? 

**zines**

Mostly Good Ideas is the publishing imprint for my zines. You can find a full copy of [How to have a low-carbon adventure](https://mostlygoodideas.nz/zine) I might upload the full copies of my portent zines when there are more additions to the series. More zines are under way! The zines that I love most though are one-off zines produced for one specific person, a form of communication I can only wholeheartedly endorse!
