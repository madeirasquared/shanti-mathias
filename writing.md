**writing for the spinoff**

I have written so many pieces for The Spinoff but these are some of my favourites and/or crowd favourites. I might add some of my favourite pieces from beloved student magazine Salient one day too. 

_longreads_

[Connecting the Chathams](https://thespinoff.co.nz/internet/10-06-2022/connecting-the-chathams) How do you get internet to somewhere hundreds of kilometres away from the nearest land? Not included in the story: a plot to grow weed around a server farm, the offer of an arranged marriage, breaking one law, holding a baby petrel. 

[International education changed India. It's changing New Zealand, too](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/08-01-2024/international-education-changed-india-its-changing-new-zealand-too-2) Everyone involved in the international education industry knows what they're trading. This is a story about the many faces of wealth. 

[Summer is for swimming. But what's in the water?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/15-12-2023/summer-is-for-swimming-but-whats-in-the-water) The idea is that you can tell how much I love swimming in rivers in this story. A joy to report! 

[Can Sandringham's South Asian flavour survive gentrification?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/08-07-2024/can-sandringhams-south-asian-flavour-survive-gentrification) Lotta knocking on doors was required for this one

[Staring down the silent epidemic of myopia in children](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/15-04-2024/staring-down-the-silent-epidemic-of-childrens-myopia) Winner of the inaugural Science Media Centre Journalism award in 2024 in the junior category <3 I loved working on this one - it's an example of an issue that is important where known interventions could make a huge difference. 

_fun stories_

[Rainbow warmth and garish colours: what happened to stripey polypro?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/08-07-2024/rainbow-warmth-and-garish-colours-when-did-stripy-polyprop-disappear) Featuring a small Shanti decked out like a synthetic zebra. 

[How far can you go without leaving your street?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/07-01-2024/how-far-can-you-go-without-leaving-your-street-2) In which Shanti spends seven days on the same road. One of those stories you really regret pitching.... 

[What's behind the explosion of apple varieties at the supermarket?](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/28-03-2024/whats-behind-the-explosion-of-apple-varieties-at-the-supermarket) and [When it comes to mangoes, New Zealanders aren't getting the good stuff](https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/14-06-2023/when-it-comes-to-mangoes-new-zealanders-arent-getting-the-good-stuff) Two delicious fruity stories! 

[Inside an exclusive, chaotic, painful NFT party](https://thespinoff.co.nz/summer-2022/31-12-2022/inside-an-exclusive-chaotic-painful-nft-party) Would NOT recommend attending an NFT party!

_essays_

[I grew up riding trains across India](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/19-02-2023/the-sunday-essay-i-grew-up-riding-trains-across-india)
[What I learned - and didn't learn - from four years of homeschooling](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/10-10-2024/what-i-learned-and-didnt-learn-from-four-years-of-home-education) Aka what was Shanti's childhood like? Kinda unusual but also great! 

[Knots](https://www.starlingmag.com/issue-9/shanti-mathias), published in Starling Magazine. 

_short stories_

If you somehow come across a copy of Sick Leave Journal's 'fiction' issue from 2021, there is a story I wrote in there! I think it's pretty good. If you are unlikely to run across copies of small Australian literary journals, email me and I can send you a pdf of the story probably. It involves cousins, pyramid schemes and anxious 19 year olds. 

_poetry_
I write one good poem every two years! My dear friend Naomii has pointed out that the hit rate would be higher if I wrote more. Maybe one day some of these poems will come to live on this website, who knows? 

**zines**

Mostly Good Ideas is the publishing imprint for my zines. You can find a full copy of [How to have a low-carbon adventure](https://mostlygoodideas.nz/zine) I might upload the full copies of my portent zines when there are more additions to the series. More zines are under way!
