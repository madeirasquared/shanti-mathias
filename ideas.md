Some of the things I'm currently thinking about.  

_music_

What does it mean to practice? What does it mean for the value of something to reveal itself in the long term? What does it mean to be moved without words being involved, especially when one is quite wordy by inclination? 

_liberation_ 

Is it a good synonym for salvation? What does work that is directed towards freedom look like? 

_water_
Which water systems are around me? How have they been hidden by human infrastructure? How is water a pattern that both societies and storytelling build off (mostly based on Water Always Wins by Erica Gies)

_the climate_

How am I letting climate change reshape my imagination? What community networks around me can I be part of, since I believe community connection is a key part of resilience? 

_fermentation_ 

What should I do to make better water kefir? What do I need to learn about natural dye fermentation in order to start dyeing stuff?

_reading_

What makes me listen to a recommendation? What are the South Asian books, especially novels, which I should read? What does it mean to 'have' to read something? _2025 update: am experimenting with finding some answers to this by going a year without reading books by Americans... don't worry Americans I still read lots of your journalism..._ 

_reporting_ 

The interview process is the hardest and weirdest and best and most magical part of being a journalist, the part I would find it so hard to stop doing. How can I report more? Where should I report from? 

_making_ 

How do I get better at chain plying? Should I get a spinning wheel? How do I stop my love of making things from becoming a love of buying things? What is the role of trends in communicating with others? Which trends are world following? What clothes can I make for a life that involves lots of time on bicycles? How can my bucket hat pattern be improved? Where can I find good deals on ripstop nylon? 

_publishing_

There are so many zines to make! I want to learn to draw maps, maybe. I want to collaborate with Shreyas on things - a biking zine? I want to become more interested in practicing Hindi maybe via zine making! I want to exchange my written work with more people.
