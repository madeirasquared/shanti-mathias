Some of the things I'm currently thinking about 

_music_ | What does it mean to practice? What does it mean for the value of something to reveal itself in the long term? What does it mean to be moved without words being involved, especially when one is quite wordy by inclination? 

_liberation_ | Is it a good synonym for salvation? What does work that is directed towards freedom look like? 

_gifts_ | How do I get things that I want without being very demanding? What does it mean to give a good gift? 

_the climate_ | How am I letting climate change reshape my imagination? 

_fermentation_ | What should I do to make better water kefir? 

_reading_ | How can I be so compelled by what other people read? What are the South Asian books, especially novels, which I should read? What does it mean to 'have' to read something? 

_reporting_ | The interview process is the hardest and weirdest and best and most magical part of being a journalist, the part I would find it so hard to stop doing. How can I report more? Where should I report from? 

_making_ | How do I get better at chain plying? Should I get a spinning wheel? How do I stop my love of making things from becoming a love of buying things? Do I need a drop-waist skirt? What clothes can I make for a life that involves lots of time on bicycles? How can my bucket hat pattern be improved? 

_publishing_ | There are so many zines to make! I want to learn to draw maps, maybe. I want to collaborate with Shreyas on things - a biking zine? I want to exchange my written work with more people.
