<p>These are some books that have really informed how I think, that I find myself returning to again and again, and recommending whole-heartedly. Most of them were extremely enjoyable reads; some were more of a struggle but ultimately worth it. If you’ve read any of these and really want to discuss, please send me a message, I love to talk about books! There is a strong recency bias on this list but hopefully I can keep updating it. This list is also much more American/British than I would like, which is something I am slowly working to change. I’m especially interested in recommendations for really great biographies that AREN’T about British literary figures… but they have to be really great.</p>
